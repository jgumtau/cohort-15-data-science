# Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem is expressed mathematically as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) [1-4]

Where:

- P(A|B) is the posterior probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened. [2-4]
- P(B|A) is the conditional probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened. [2, 5, 6]
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening. [2, 7]
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening. [2, 7]
