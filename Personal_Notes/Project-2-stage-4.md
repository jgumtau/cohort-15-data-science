Project 2: Housing Price Prediction

Outlines the project goals and requirements
Emphasizes using regression prediction techniques with feature scaling and regularization
Aims to minimize the Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE) on house sales price predictions
Imports

Imports necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning
Loading the Data

Loads the housing data from a CSV file hosted on AWS S3
Create Data Frame

Creates a pandas DataFrame from the loaded data
Identifies the target variable (SalePrice)
Distinguishes between categorical and numerical columns
Assesses unique values in categorical columns
Examines categorical variables for potential issues (e.g., too many unique values, imbalanced categories)
Data Cleaning

Isolates float64 data columns
Handles missing values by dropping the 'Lot Frontage' column and imputing missing values in other columns
Prepares cleaned feature data for correlation analysis
Feature Selection / EDA

Performs initial correlation visualization of remaining features
Selects features based on correlation with SalePrice
Prepares data for modeling by splitting into training and testing sets
Applies feature scaling to the selected features
Ridge Modelling

Creates and evaluates a Ridge regression model
Calculates and reports RMSE, RMSPE, and R-squared
Visualizes actual vs predicted house prices
RFE Modelling

Implements Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Random Forest Regressor
Evaluates the RFE-selected model using RMSE, RMSPE, and R-squared
Visualizes actual vs predicted house prices for the RFE model
RFECV Modelling

Implements Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV)
Selects optimal features and visualizes cross-validation scores
Creates and evaluates a new linear regression model using RFECV-selected features
Calculates and reports RMSE, RMSPE, and R-squared
Visualizes actual vs predicted house prices for the RFECV model
Your project follows a coherent and logical order, covering the essential steps of the data science process:

Problem definition
Data loading and exploration
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Feature selection and engineering
Model building and evaluation
Model comparison and refinement
For your presentation, you can focus on:

The project goals and dataset description
Key insights from the exploratory data analysis
The feature selection process and its importance
Comparison of different modeling approaches (Ridge, RFE, RFECV)
Final model performance and interpretation of results
Potential areas for further improvement or investigation
This structure should provide a comprehensive overview of your work while highlighting the most important aspects of your housing price prediction project.
